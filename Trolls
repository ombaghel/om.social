Don't become a troll.

How?
If a person enters a conversation with a goal to win as though there is a contest or battle the person is a troll. 

Simply do not engage this person, engaging means having toxic holy war not worth it.
EXIT!

Dont be bait!
keep your opinion reserve if its not worth fight!
